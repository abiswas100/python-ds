# Python Program for implementation of 
# Recursive Bubble sort 
# Here we are working out the bubble sort algorithm within a recursive function.

# How to implement it recursively?
#Recursive Bubble Sort has no performance/implementation advantages, but can be a good question to check #oneâ€™s understanding of Bubble Sort and recursion.
#If we take a closer look at Bubble Sort algorithm, we can notice that in first pass, we move largest #element to end (Assuming sorting in increasing order). In second pass, we move second largest element to # 3second last position and so on.

# Recursion Idea.
#    1. Base Case: If array size is 1, return.
#    2. Do One Pass of normal Bubble Sort. This pass fixes last element of current subarray.
#    3. Recur for all elements except last of current subarray.
